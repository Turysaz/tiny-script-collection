An example of how to pack and encrypt with 7z
=============================================


7z a -t7z archivename.7z -xr!*exclude* -pusethispassword -mhe -v100m -mx9

a       -- ADD to archive with the given name
-xr!    -- exclude all this (with wildcards)
-p      -- use the following password (no space in between)
-mhe    -- encrypt filenames, too
-v      -- split into parts of the size ...
-mx9    -- maximum compression (1-9)
